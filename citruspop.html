            <h2>About Citrus POP!</h2>
            <p>Citronaut is on the beach planting citrobombs to sandcastles and non-UCF-affiliated Knights who are trying to ruin his fun!</p>
            <p><strong>Citrus POP!</strong> is based on Bomberman with a University of Central Florida (UCF) theme.</p>
            <p>This is the first project for my game production class. We were required to recreate a classic arcade game and add a UCF theme to it. Each person needed to create at lease one art asset
                and we were all learning how to use GitHub Desktop as version control while using Unity Engine.</p>

            <p>This section will be regularly updated with progress reports, development challenges, and milestones.</p>
            <h3>Devlog 1: Starting with Unreal Engine</h3>
            <p>In the early stages of development, we decided to use Unreal Engine for its powerful capabilities in rendering and handling complex environments. My main focus during this phase was to set up the game’s technical architecture, including core mechanics like movement and interaction.</p>
            <h3>Devlog 2: User Interface Design</h3>
            <p>As the technical designer, I worked closely with the UI team to design a clean, intuitive interface. We focused on creating interactive elements that feel immersive and match the overall tone of the game.</p>

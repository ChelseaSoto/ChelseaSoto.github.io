            <h2>About Revenant</h2>
            <p>Fight and solve puzzles to save your dead lover. How much are you willing to sacrifice to restore what was once yours?</p>
            <p><strong>Revenant: Through The Veil</strong> is a third-person action-adventure game that centers around Egyption mythology and The Book of the Dead.
            <p>This is a game I am working on as part of my senior capstone project at the University of Central Florida. It is my first time working with Unreal Engine, and I am the technical designer and UI programmer for a development team of 14 people.</p>

            <h3>Devlog 1: Starting with Unreal Engine</h3>
            <p>In the early stages of development, we decided to use Unreal Engine for its powerful capabilities in rendering and handling complex environments. My main focus during this phase was to set up the game’s technical architecture, including core mechanics like movement and interaction.</p>
            <h3>Devlog 2: User Interface Design</h3>
            <p>As the technical designer, I worked closely with the UI team to design a clean, intuitive interface. We focused on creating interactive elements that feel immersive and match the overall tone of the game.</p>

                <p><strong>Revenant: Through The Veil</strong> is a third-person action-adventure game developed by Excavator Studios that centers around Egyption mythology and The Book of the Dead.
                <p>This is a game I am working on as part of my senior capstone project at the University of Central Florida. It is my first time working with Unreal Engine, and I am the technical
                    designer and UI programmer for a development team of 14 people.</p>

                        <h3>Devlog 1: Starting with Unreal Engine</h3>
                        <span>October 5, 2024</span>
                    </div>

                    <p>In the early stages of development, we decided to use Unreal Engine 5.3.2 for its powerful capabilities in rendering and handling complex environments.</p>
                    <p>For our prototype submission, we were required to have a main menu that allows us to go into our code prototype and our art prototype. In order to return
                        to the main menu while in one of the prototypes, I also added in a pause menu.
                    </p>
                    <p> One of the requirements for our game is to have it function with an XBOX One controller, and so I also researched and implemented functionality to used gamepad
                        and keyboard into the menus. This was a super complicated process for me since this is my first time using Unreal but I got it to work in the main menu.
                    </p>
                </div>
                
                <div class="devlog-entry" id="devlog-2">
                    <div class="devlog-header">

                    </div>

                    <p>After Hurricane Milton passed through, I finalized the gamepad/keyboard functionality for the pause menu and bug fixed it. I also added the D-Pad functionality
                        for using abilities in our game. We have the player obtain four different abilities by the end of the game, and they'll be mapped onto numbers 1, 2, 3, and 4
                        on the keyboard and on the D-Pad for the gamepad. I also added in a functional healthbar since the programmers on our team were adding the health system into
                        the game.
                    </p>

                        <span>October 24, 2024</span>                       
                    </div>

                    <p>Our UI designer created the options menu widget blueprint and its functionality to change resolution, graphics quality, and whether the game is in full screen or 
                        windowed mode.
                    </p>
                    <p>I linked the options menu to both the main menu and pause menu and worked on the gamepad functionality for it. This was by far the hardest thing I encountered
                        so far in this project.
                    </p>
                    <p>After figuring out different options that I can take without changing up our UI designer's design too much, I added an additional horizontal box with buttons to follow
                        the same method I used in the previous menus, but without needed to click the actual buttons. The buttons are highlighting what option the player is on and the player
                        can flick the joystick left or right to select the specific setting that they want. I felt this was the best decision to make in terms of user experience so that the
                        player doesn't need to use their joystick to navigate through all the left and right buttons for each option.

                    <p>Our UI designer created the HUD assets for the health and stamina of our player and so I added it in and put it on the HUD how she and the others wanted it.

                    <p>When going into a level of our game, the lights take a while to get where they're supposed to. I believe part of it is the dynamic lighting, but I wanted to
                        see if the issue can be fixed with a loading screen. I put a lot of research into this because a lot of solutions have to do with level streaming, which
                        would conflict with all the progress the programmers and level designers have already made. Another solution was completely coding async loading screens with C++;
                        however, the university computers apparently don't like the use of C++. With the professor's permission, we are using the
                        <a href = "https://www.fab.com/listings/f8aabb9a-7c96-4f79-97ff-04bcc146e595">Async Loading Screen</a> plugin. This plugin allows us to have multiple loading screen
                        backgrounds and text to choose from at random in between changing levels. Unfortunately, the university computers also cannot download plugins so we've been keeping
                        this in a separate branch on GitHub and will refine it when we're closer to submission. But it's good to know it exists.

                    </div>

                    <p> I implemented the assets our UI designer created. Throughout the game, an ability is always selected, but we want the UI to show which ability is selected and which button on the D-Pad to click for the other ability. I have the basic functionality implemented in to change which image shows based on
                        which ability is chosen; however, I still need to add conditionals to show specific images based on which abilities have been unlocked.
                    </p>
                    <p>I also fixed some scaling issues by adding a scale box and size box to each widget blueprint.</p>

                    <p>I was out of town this weekend and Thanksgiving is in a few days, so right now I'm preparing for our vertical slice submission. I mainly focused on updating our Game Design Document
                        and Technical Design Document as well as creating data tables for some of our visual novel cutscenes.
                    </p>
                    <p>For the Vertical Slice, I felt that we should have a credit screen since we've all been working hard on this game. I wanted to make a credit screen similar to the end
                        of a movie since our game is heavy on its narrative. We'll be having other people voice act and make music for our game, so the credit screen will get longer.
                    </p>
                    <p>For its functionality, I added in the scrolling animation and have it start when the widget blueprint gets added to viewport. I also attempted to do the gamepad
                        functionality process I've been doing for the previous menus (it didn't work). Once I revisit it, I am going to just have the button there for mouse, but add a 
                        keybind to exit out of the credit screen by default.
                    </p>

                    <p>This is the hardest thing I've done by far. I created a duplicate of the dialogue box widget blueprint to work on it without causing conflicts or issues while our UI
                        designer works on the original blueprint. With the mixture of the timecrunch, and complexity of the blueprints I was creating (plus watching YouTube videos about it),
                        I decided to save this for next semester and focus on bug fixing while also working on other finals that I have this week.

                    <p>We presented our vertical slice to our class. Technically we don't have to work on this project until Spring semester starts, but I want to work more during this winter

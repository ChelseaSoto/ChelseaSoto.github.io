            <h2>About Red Handed</h2>
            <p>You've been caught red handed!</p>
            <p><strong>Red Handed</strong> is a stealth game where an art thief must steal a priceless statue from a heavily guarded art museum.</p>
            <p>This was a project for game production where we were required to have a hallway and two guards. Our game was developed on Unity engine and I worked on programming UI, interactions with objects,
                learned how to use keyframes to animate opening and closing the doors, as well as fixing many errors in GitHub.</p>

            <h3>Devlog 1: Starting with Unreal Engine</h3>
            <p>In the early stages of development, we decided to use Unreal Engine for its powerful capabilities in rendering and handling complex environments. My main focus during this phase was to set up the game’s technical architecture, including core mechanics like movement and interaction.</p>
            <h3>Devlog 2: User Interface Design</h3>
            <p>As the technical designer, I worked closely with the UI team to design a clean, intuitive interface. We focused on creating interactive elements that feel immersive and match the overall tone of the game.</p>

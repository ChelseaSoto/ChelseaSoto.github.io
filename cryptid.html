            <h2>About Cryptid Control</h2>
            <p>You are called in to capture Cryptid by the company you work for: Cryptid Control.</p>
            <p>While in the HubWorld you can enter the portals to go to the levels to fight enemies and capture their bosses, the Cryptids.</p>
            <p>We have three bosses, Mothman, Siren, and the Fresno Nightcrawler.</p>
            <p>Capture all three and you win.</p>
            <p> </p>
            <p>This is our final project for my game production class. We used Unity Engine and at this point into the semester, I was more
                confident in my skill using GitHub as well as programming the menus and cutscenes. I learnt that I wanted to stick to the technical
                side of design.</p>

            <h3>Devlog 1: Starting with Unreal Engine</h3>
            <p>In the early stages of development, we decided to use Unreal Engine for its powerful capabilities in rendering and handling complex environments. My main focus during this phase was to set up the game’s technical architecture, including core mechanics like movement and interaction.</p>
            <h3>Devlog 2: User Interface Design</h3>
            <p>As the technical designer, I worked closely with the UI team to design a clean, intuitive interface. We focused on creating interactive elements that feel immersive and match the overall tone of the game.</p>
